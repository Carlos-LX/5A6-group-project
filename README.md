# Book Craft

## Goal
Book Craft is a new cutting-edge social platform aimed at making users discover new books to read. We inspired ourselves from Instagram, Facebook, Spotify and Pinterest to give the user a whole new experience. We hope that people will discover stories and give an accessible way to venture into the world of imagination.
